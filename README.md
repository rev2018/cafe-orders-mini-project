# Cafe Orders Mini Project

This is a simple command-line based cafe ordering system implemented in Python. It allows users to select items from a categorized menu, track their order in real-time, and calculate the total bill based on their selections. This version of the project is intentionally written without using functions to keep the logic linear and easy to follow.

## Features

- Categorized menu: Savory, Desserts, Beverages
- Continuous item ordering with confirmation after each step
- Real-time display of the order and total price
- Simple input prompts for easy user interaction
